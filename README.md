# extract_msx_font
jupyter notebook to extract the fonts from msx system ROMs

You must use the BASIC roms. Just put .ROM files in the same directory as the notebook and run it.

I added a hardcoded exception for the ax170_arabic.rom. Others will grab data from CGTABL (0x0004) variable inside the ROM.
